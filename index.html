            Traffic jams have many bad giteffects. They stress out drivers and passengers, make them angry, and can even
            cause accidents. They also time and money because people cant get where they need to go, and they use
            more fuel, which is bad for the environment.

            To fix traffic jams, governments need to make better transportation policies and roads. They can invest in
            public transportation, encourage carpooling, and use technology to manage traffic better.

            In conclusion, traffic jams are a big problem that causes stress and costs money. We need to do things like
            improving public transportation and planning roadwork better to fix it.
